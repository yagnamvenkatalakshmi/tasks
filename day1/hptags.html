            Plants are living organisms that belong to the kingdom <span class="highlight">Plantae</span>. 
            They are essential for life on Earth as they produce oxygen, provide food, and offer shelter 
            for countless species. Plants are unique because they can make their own food through 
            a process called <span class="highlight">photosynthesis</span>.
        </p>
